A simple dark theme for the keil uvision IDE

## Install steps:   
NOTE: MAKE SURE KEIL IS CLOSED AND NOT RUNNING FOR THE ENTIRE PROCESS!!!  
1. Follow this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLZx_qsOltc) yt video and install the cascadia code font.  
2. Go to keil install folder, click on the "UV4" folder.  
3. Find "global.prop", copy and paste this file somewhere safe so you don't loose the OG settings.  
4. Download my new global.prop file from this GitHub.  
5. Locate the downloaded file and paste in the "UV4" folder inside of the keil installation folder.  
6. Launch Keil! It should work, I'll be making some improvements to the asm theme but this should be okay for now.
